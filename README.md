Fractpic is a simple fractal generator, with (almost) infinite zoom.

## Installation

## Usage

```bash
		    ./fractol [key]
```                                  
		          Supported fractals:          
		       [mandelbrot] [sierpinski]       
		       [poincare] [julia] [cubic]

		     $(WAC)./fractol julia cubic$(OKC)             
		                                       
		   Will launch 2 separate processes.
